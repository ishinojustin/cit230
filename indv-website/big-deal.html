        <h1 id="android-history">Finally A Big Deal</h1>
        <h2>Momentum had been building behind Android throughout its first year on the market. But it wasn't until 2010 that things really took off.</h2>
        <p>Google contiued its own-branded device efforts with the forward-thinking Nexus program, but more importanntly a number of high-profile Android phones from Motorola, HTC and Samsung brought a surge in device activations. Google's OS also went through three major versions, and looked to compete with the brand new iPad with the first Android-powered tablet.</p>

        <h3>Nexus One: The Google Phone</h3>
        <p>In 2009 Christmas came early for some especially inside Google. It had quickly became common knowledge that Google was working on a new phone. It went as far as many Googlers were walking around with them. So there were several weeks of leaks and unoffical walkthroughs before the HTC-manufactured Nexus One was unveiled on Jan 5, 2010.</p>

        <p>The phone in all regards was near futuristic for the time, especially considering it came just a month or so after the blocky &#40;but popular&#41; Motorola Droid on Verizon. This truly was the first sleek smartphone running Android. Basic specs included a 3.7-inch AMOLED display &#40;at 800x480 resolution&#41;, a 1GHz Snapdragon 8250 processor, 512 megabytes of on-board storage and microSD card support. It had a 1400mAh battery and a 5-megapixel camera.</p>

        <p>With the Nexus One it also marked the start of the "Pure Google" experience. No manufacturer skins. No carrier bloatware. The Nexus platform would showcase the best of Google's Android software, before it was marred by any carrier or OEM. What's more important is the Google was looking to revolutionize the way we purchased phones. Turns out it was a little ahead of it's time. Google was selling the Nexus One online only, SIM unlocked, and outside of the grasp of the U.S. carriers.</p>

        <p>Everything wasn't all sunshine and rainbows in the Nexus camp however. There were some set backs and missteps in the beginning, the early days saw a good bit of confusion, especially in regards of support for the Nexus One. When the inevitable problems arose - as the always do with a new product - Google and HTC at first sort of pointed fingers and each other yelling &quot;Not it&#33;&quot; Was it a Google Phone? Was it an HTC phone? It wasn't really clear, Google finally worked out some phone support &#40;for the phone&#41; about a month in.</p>

        <h3>Not Only Nexus</h3>
        <p>Even though the Nexus One was an important historical first for Google, the device itself never saw much commercial success. The phones that would drive Android activation numbers overdrive came about through different kinds of partnerships. Two of the big hitters of 2010 belonged to HTC. Internationally, the Nexus One's close cousin the HTC Desire debuted with almost identical internals and the company's Sense UI - bolstered by a major marketing push that the Nexus never enjoyed. During this time, HTC's &quot;quietly brilliant&quot; handsets were the public face of Android, with the iconic Sense clock widget appearing in advertisements across Europe.</p>

        <p>In the U.S., mobile operators were looking for their own "hero" handsets to combat the AT&amp;T-exclusive iPhone. The first and most visible was the Motorola-built Droid on Verizon. This, the first phone to run Android 2.0 Eclair, was backed by an extensive feature list &#40;including an all-important physical keyboard&#41; and an enormous marketing budget. And soon the slogan &quot;Droid Does&quot; encapsulated the idea that Android phones weren't just pretenders to the iPhone's throne, but devices that could be even more capable. The Droid brand soon spawned a lineage of handsets, including the touchscreen-centric Droid X and the HTC-made Desire lookalike the Droid Incredible.</p>

        <p>Samsung not to be out done by HTC gave us the first Galaxy S phone. It wasn't the first Android-based Samsung phone, nor the first in the Galaxy series, but the original Galaxy S was the first to bring Samsung's A-game to a flagship smartphone. Samsung's SuperAMOLED technology made its debut, as did it's 1GHz &quot;Hummingbird&quot; processor.</p>
