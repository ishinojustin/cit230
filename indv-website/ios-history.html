            A Breif History of iOS</h1>
        <p>Apple first launched is mobile OS on June 29, 2007 - but back then it was called iPhone OS. This came on the very first iPhone. Since then, the mobile operating system has gone through some major upgrades. This happened over the last ten years, each year building on the success of the year before constantly adding new features to iOS.</p>

        <br>

        <p><strong>iPhone OS 1</strong></p>
        <p>This is what started it all with the first iPhone in 2007. This first iPhone is perhaps on eof the most important gadgets of all time. It took ideas from the young mobile industry and made them more people friendly. The candy bar sized display defines smartphone design to this day. It also created the basic "SpringBoard" app - a grid of apps on a screen - taht hasn't changed much in ten years.</p>
        <p>iPhone OS may have introduced multi-touch and the general ideas underlying Apple's ideas for mobile computing, but the operating systems greatest success was selling an idea that an iPod, camera, phone, and internet device could really be packed into one device that would fit into your pocket - and be somthing that you actually wanted to use.</p>

        <p><strong>iPhone OS 2</strong></p>
        <p>As the years passed and iPhone OS was updated new features where added most notibly was the addition of third-party apps in iPhone OS 2.Not only were third-party apps added to the new OS but also location services through the added GPS hardware in the new iPhone 3G.</p>

        <p><strong>iOS 4</strong></p>
        <p>In the following year after iPhone OS 2 apple seemed to take a step back from adding features and improved upon what they already had in iPhone OS 3 there were only minor changed to design, this wouldn't come until a year later.</p>
        <p>With three years under their belt and Apple adding the their mobile computing arsenal the name of iPhone OS was changed, they dropped the "Phone" from it's mobile OS. Giving birth the iOS which now ran on iPod, iPhone and the newly announced iPad. In addition there were two big features that came with the shiny new iOS, FaceTime and MultiTasking.</p>
        <p>Apple helped establish an ambitious new communication frontier, making the futuristic concept of video phones a reality, if you had the iPhone 4. At the time, there was nothing that worked nearly as well. It would be several years before desktop software like Skype was finally made available on mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Apple also began copying the best ideas from the competition - this time in the form of multitasking. Google had long implemented a limited multitasking feature with Android and would soon copy Palm's WebOS - based "cards" multitasking model (also copied by Android) in iOS 7.</p>
        <p><strong>iOS 5, 6</strong></p>
        <p>In the coming years iOS grew up and added more and more features with iOS 5 they added Notification Center, iMessage, Siri, and iCloud. The platform was beginning to blossom into the modern operating system we know today. Apple began to build conveniences on top of its core services like SMS/MMS support and push notifications. With the integration of iMessages, Apple joined the growing popularity of other messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
        <p>In 2011 Siri was unveiled and at the time was an unbelievable idea. A personal assistant, on your phone, that can do actions on your behalf. It could even tell jokes. It was far superior to any voice control features in other phones at the time.</p>
        <p>With iOS 6 Apple launched its own mapping service, Apple Maps, along with Passbook, for storing plane tickets, coupons, and other digital content. Siri also got a much needed update.</p>
        <p>With the release of Apple Maps it was clear that Apple and Google were no longer friends. Google Maps was well-regarded as the best online mapping service. With iOS 6 Apple was challenging Google's mapping supremacy. To Apple's dismay it launched a less-than-stellar competitor and sacrificed customer service in pursuit of expanding its software reach.</p>
        <p><strong>iOS 7</strong></p>
        <p>iOS 7 came with a major overhaul in UX design, with a more simple design, flatter icons, and Helvetica font. Apps were given edge-to-edge designs and a new parallax-scrolling home screen. Apple also introduced the frosted glass Control Center, for quick access to options like flashlight, Bluetooth, and another new feature, AirDrop.</p>
        <p>At WWDC 2013 Tim Cook described iOS 7 as &quot;the biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone.&quot; It was the first <i>significant</i> design change from any mobile operating system that had come before.</p>
        <p><strong>iOS 8</strong></p>
        <p>With the all-new look, Apple returned its focus to iOS usability, specifically giving developers more control throughout iOS. Apple would finally allow third-party keyboards, widgets &#40;after a fashion&#41; and the ability to share files from different apps and services.</p>
        <p>For many years, people could use third-party widgets and keyboards on Android. With iOS 8, Apple finally gave developers tools to dig deeper into its operating system. Even though not the first to the market, Apple Pay may arguably have been the most complete mobile payments platform at the time.</p>
        <p><strong>iOS 9</strong></p>
        <p>With iOS 9 Apple seemed to be in catch-up mode, it seemed that almost everything Apple announced had a tinge of &quot;been there, done that.&quot; Micrsoft and Samsung had been doing multi-window support for years, Spotify had been out in the US for nearly four years. 3D Touch was a new feature for smartphones. It created context menus for apps on the iPhone home screen and other convenient shortcuts in Mail and keyboard apps.</p>
