        <h1 id="android-history">A Modern OS</h1>
        <h2>As Android hit its stride on phones, a new tablet release brought the OS onto bigger screens, and a new design language took its look and feel to the next level.</h2>
        <p>By the end of 2010 Android had become a force to be reckoned with on smartphones. The following year would see Google's OS properly branch out into tablets with the slate-centric &#40;but ill-fated&#41; Honeycomb release before reuniting the phone and tablet branches in Ice Cream Sandwich, the biggest change to Android in its history thus far. With &quot;ICS&quot; came an entirely new visual style, and a stonger focus on design. And thanks to a partnership with Samsung, Android 4.0 debuted on a phone with a technical milestone to its name.</p>

        <h3>Honeycomb</h3>
        <p>Android 3.0 went by the codename &quot;Honeycomb.&quot; In December 2010 Andy Rubin strode onto the &quot;D: Drive Into Mobile&quot; stage in San Francisco with a little surprise tucked under his arm. A tablet from Motorola with a new version of Android on board.</p>

        <p>Up until this point Android tablets only were large displays with the phone version hacked onto them, and it didn't feel right.</p>

        <p>This prototype tablet and OS was to launch were meant to change that. A new &quot;holographic&quot; design language and new notifications. Things were <i>different</i>. This device came to be known as the Motorola Xoom. Which came with it's own issues, the tablet initially shipped with 3G and not LTE - but Motorola would retrofit tablets if they were mailed back in. Adobe Flash wasn't supported at launch. Nor was the microSD card slot.</p>

        <p>But moreover is that what was waited for the Honeycomb source code to be made open-source, like the rest of the Android releases. That day never came. Conventional wisdom tells that Google recognized the trouble both with the design and the operation of Honeycomb, and the we'd end up with some serious FrankenPhones should it be released into the wild.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, all this gave the impression of an OS that was rushed to launch to prevent Apple from dominating the nascent tablet market</p>

        <p>And so Honeycomb very quickly began to die on the vine. In fact, the Xoom was the only device ever released with Android 3.0. The slimmer Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 landed at Google I/O 2011, with Android 3.1. The Xoom was updated to Android 4.0.x Ice Cream Sandwich before it was abandoned. Today, even the Android Platform Versions dashboard - which keeps a running tally of the percentage of active devices on various versions of the OS - has no mentions of Honeycomb.</p>

        <h3>The Hight of HTC</h3>
        <p>Going into 2011, HTC was king of the Andorid hill. The Taiwanese manufacturer's early bet on Google's OS had paid off, with monthly sales exceedeing $1 billion and a prized position as the U.S.'s biggest smartphone manufacturer in the third quarter of that year.</p>

        <p>The HTC Sense flip clock was a familiar sight in advertisements around the world. New handsets arrived to rave reviews. HTC was the public face of Android, the e facto alternative to the iPhone. The sheer success of HTC was perhaps best quantified by the events it was able to put on.</p>

        <h3>Ice Cream Sandwich and Holo</h3>
        <p>By late 2011 it was time for Android's biggest upgrade to date, reunifying the smartphone and teblety branches of the OS and defining its look, feel and technical underpinnings for coming years.</p>

        <p>Android's new Holo design philosophy was inteded to remedy that, creating a more consistent, more modern interface with clean typography an da flatter aesthetic. The "Roboto" typeface was introduced, designed for high-density displays like the Galaxy Nexus's state-of-the-art 720p panel. And Google broke with the stale grey-white gradients of the past, and teh skeuomorphic woods and leathers of iOS at the time. Buttons, controls and icons in ICS felt a little bit futuristic, but less overtly sci-fi than Honeycomb's seemingly Tron-inspired UI.</p>

        <h3>Samsung S2 and Note</h3>
        <p>With the launch of the original Galaxy S marked that Samsung got serious about Andriod as a platform, the Galaxy S2 was the Korean company going all-in on smartphone hardware. Released in 2011 the Galaxy S2 saw Samsung leapfrog the competition with its own dual-core Exynos processor and a shiny SuperAMOLED+ screen.</p>

        <p>Having worked closely with Google on the Nexus S, Samsung was also able to bring more responsive performance than ever to its 2011 flagship. In an era when speedy performance on high-end phones wasn't guaranteed, the GS2 was silky smooth on Android 2.3 Gingerbread.</p>

        <p>By IFA 2011 Android was rolling along and Samsung was ready to change the game. It released a quirky new smartphone, a really, really big phone.</p>

        <p>This was the first Samsung Galaxy Note, a phone with a 5.3-inch display in 16:10 aspect ratio, and one of the first HD SuperAMOLED displays to hit the market. And the big screen wasn't just for decoration - Samsung expected Note customers to use the extra screen real estate for work as well as entertainment. Hence the inclusion of the Wacom-powered &quot;S-pen&quot; a pressure-sensitive stylus that didn't require any battery of its own.</p>

        <p>The idea was that younger consumers would use it for creative pursuits, while business types would appreciate the extra space for emails and productivity. It's debatable whether that paradigm really played out in the real world, or whether both camps simply wanted to see more of what they were already doing. In any case, the Galaxy Note was a surprising success.</p>

        <p>Though mocked at the time the Note series from Samsung came to define a new category of smartphone &quot;the Phablet&quot; which came to be incredibly popular among many people. So much so that even after the ill fated Galaxy Note 7 recall in 2016, there were still many people anxoiusly awaiting the next king of the Phablet in 2017.</p>
