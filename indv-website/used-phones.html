        <h1>Pros and Cons of Buying Used Smartphones</h1>
        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <ol id="prosCons">
            <li><b>Price</b>
                <p>The main benefit of buying a used smartphone is that the cost is considerably lower than that of buying new. Often times you can even find the newest smartphone models being sold used online! Even when buying last year's phones in the store they can come with a pretty steep price. On the other hand, when when someone already used the phone, the price goes down, and it often goes down a lot.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Options</b>
                <p>Do you really need a new phone? If you are not crazy about having the latest and greatest tech there are a lot of options to choose from when buying a used phone. The big carriers and box stores only carry the latest phones that have come out in the last few months. But on some popular sites such as eBay, Swappa, and others you can find a wide range of phone options, even ones that came out a few years ago.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Environmental Concerns</b>
                <p>The vast majority of used phones for sale are barely a year old and the only reason that they are up for sale is that the owners bought a new phone. What happens to all these used phones, they end up in a landfill as tech waste. This tech waste is one of the biggest issues, tons of phones are thrown away every year, and that waste keeps getting bigger.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>No Warranty</b>
                <p>We you are buying a used phone you are usually getting no warranty. So if the phone starts to misbehave you will have to pay for any repairs out of pocket. However often times you can look at the reseller's site to see if they offer some kind of warranty. These warranties are often shorter than what the manufacturer warranty is, but at least it is something.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Don't Know What the Phone's been through</b>
                <p>You can be the most meticulous person in the world but there is no way to know for sure what is the actual condition the phone can be in. There are always things that can't be checked such as battery, data, or the phone could even be stolen in such case you could be looking at buying a new device anyway.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Do You Trust Then</b>
                <p>This comes down to the issue of do you trust who is on the other end of the transaction. Buying used things, especially buying phones online can be a tricky business. Just like anything there are good and bad sellers out there, So it's up to you to determine if you are going to trust the seller. Always do your research and read the reviews for the seller especially on sites such as eBay.</p>
