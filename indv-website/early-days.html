        <h1>Android, Early Days</h1>
        <p><strong>T-Mobile G1</strong></p>
        <p>Just like the Palm Treo, or original iPhone, the T-Mobile G1 changed everything about the way that we do things on our smartphones, and without it it would be considerably different -- and likely not nearly as good -- without it.</p>

        <p>In terms of hardware there really wasn't anything revolutionary about the G1. The hardware was chunky, and the shape included a chin that you either loved or hated. It had physical buttons for navigating the menu, home, and back -- as well as answering calls and a clickable trackball were tough to get used to for many users.</p>

        <p>As good as the hardware was at the time this is not the thing that made the G1 special. That would be the software. The G1, being the first consumer device ever to run Android, released what is now the beast Google to the world of mobile technology.</p>

        <p>From the G1 came many updates not only to the hardware but most importantly the software. In April 2009 version 1.5 (Cupcake) was released, it was the first major release followed by 1.6 (Donut). They introduced many of the essential features that we now have in our Android phones today.</p>

        <p><strong>Cupcakes &amp; Donuts</strong></p>

        <p>Cupcake paved the way for touchscreen intigration with android phones. This helped introduce third-pary keyboards, home screen widgets, and basic video recording capabilities for the camera.</p>

        <p>Later Donut was released the same year, laying the groundwork for even greater variety of the Android hardware, with support for different display resolutions and densities, and native support for CDMA networks. Through out that year and the ones following Android continued to evolve and grow as a mobile platform.</p>

        <p><strong>Droid Does</strong></p>

        <p>2010 marked a turning point for Android with the launch of the Motorola Droid. In collaboration with Verizon, Motorola, and Google the Motorola Droid was created to combat the iPhone. This was evident in Verizons marketing efforts. The Droid Does campain included multitasking jabs and demostrations of the voice search capabilities, and was a spectacular success.</p>

        <p>All of this eventually paved the way for the modernization of Android and the rise of Google's dominance of the mobile phone space.</p>
