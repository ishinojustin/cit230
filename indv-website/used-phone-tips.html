        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Do Your Reseearch</h2>
                <p>The whole reason you are buying a used phone is to get the best price, so you need to put in effort and do a little research. To get the best deals, you will need to see how many people are selling that phone and at what price. Search for the phone on site like eBay, Craigslist and Swappa. Some things to note would be.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure that it is unlocked, they might go for a little more than their carrier locked counterparts but the ease of activation will pay off in the long run.</li>
                    <li>When looking on eBay check only the Buy It Now prices, not the current bids. The bids will tell you only what another person is willing to pay for a phone not what the sellers look for.</li>
                    <li>Check the price of a new phone. If you could get a similar spec'd phone that is new you are losing out on the manufacturer's warranty that might come in handy.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that you know what accessories you are getting. This might not be important to some but to others not getting a charge cord or wall adapter can be a deal breaker.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Inspect the Phone</h2>
                <p>When you buy a used phone it is always beneficial to inspect the phone to make sure that it is in the condition described. To do this make sure you have somethings handy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your own charge cable for the device.</li>
                    <li>A laptop/ computer</li>
                    <li>Your SIM card that can fit in the phone.</li>
                    <li>Headphones</li>
                    <li>A microSD card (if the phone has a slot for one)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you have the phone in your hands you should run some checks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physically inspect the phone.</strong> You are checking for any damage to the phone, like dents and scratches, as well as signs of wather damage. Pay particular attention to scratches on the camera lens.</li>
                    <li><strong>If It Opens, Open It.</strong> Any thing that you can open or take out of the phone open it, this means flaps, ports, and covers - such as a SIM card slot or microSD card.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check all the ports.</strong> Using your own headphones and charge cable make sure that they are working properly. Also make sure that the included accessories work as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pop in you SIM card.</strong> Start using the phone make a call, send a text, and pull up your favorite social media feed. This is the best way to check if all these parts of the phone are working. If the phone happens to be locked to a carrier network that you are not on you'll soon know it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Run the service code test.</strong> This will be different for each phone manufacturer, but most phones have a special menu to check different parts of the phone are working. For example on the Galaxy S8 from Samsung typing &quot;&#42;&#35;0&#42;&#35;&quot; without quotes, will get you to the test menu were you can check different aspects like touch screen, dimming, speaker, cameras, receiver, vibration, RGB, sensors, and much more. Go through each one to make sure that everything on the phone is working fine.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Know when to buy</h2>
                <p>If you're looking to get the most recent phone model as possible while maximizing your savings, the best time to buy a used smartphone is just after its successor comes out, which is when all of the early adopters sell the previous generation of their smartphones. Even though specific dates for phones can change, the general release calendar is pretty set. Top offerings from Samsung, LG, and HTC are announced in early spring, followed by Apple in late summer to early fall. Then there are still other Android models &#45; such ar Google's Pixel, Samsung Galaxy Note, and LG V series &#45; typically come out later in the year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Know the return policy</h2>
                <p>If you're not buying from a carrier or phone maker, at least try to get your phone from a reseller that offers a rock&#45;solid return policy. While most physical damage is easy to spot when you first receive the phone, it can take more time to detect hardware and software malfunctions. Take into considetation the return window, and once the sale is complete, make a note of the final day when you're allowed to return it, just in case.</p>
